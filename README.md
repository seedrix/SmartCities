# People Guidance System for Shopping Malls

Monitoring and guiding people in shopping malls are crucial to decrease the risk of infection with the Coronavirus. We propose a highly scalable and fault-tolerant system that combines the automatic measurement of the occupancy of each shop with an AI planning-based approach that guides customers in the shopping mall such that all customers are distributed equally  among  the  shops  regarding  the  preferences  of  the  customers.  Furthermore,  displays in front of the shops can prohibit entry if the maximum number of people is exceeded. The measuring of the number of people is done by evaluating camera, Bluetooth, and WiFi data. Additionally, customers can view and evaluate the historical data for each shop to find time slots with less occupancy.
