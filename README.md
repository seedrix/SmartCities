# People Guidance System for Shopping Malls

Monitoring and guiding people in shopping malls are crucial to decrease the riskof infection with the Coronavirus. We propose a highly scalable and fault-tolerant system thatcombines the automatic measurement of the occupancy of each shop with an AI planning-basedapproach that guides customers in the shopping mall such that all customers are distributedequally  among  the  shops  regarding  the  preferences  of  the  customers.  Furthermore,  displaysin front of the shops can prohibit entry if the maximum number of people is exceeded. Themeasuring of the number of people is done by evaluating camera, Bluetooth, and WiFi data.Additionally, customers can view and evaluate the historical data for each shop to find timeslots with less occupancy.
